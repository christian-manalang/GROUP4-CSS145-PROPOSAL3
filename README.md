# Japan Birth Rate Dashboard using Streamlit

A data-driven web application to analyze and predict Japan's birth rate trends using historical data from 1899 to 2022. This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Time Series Forecasting**, and **Linear Regression Modeling** to identify key factors influencing birth rates and project future rates over the next five years.
