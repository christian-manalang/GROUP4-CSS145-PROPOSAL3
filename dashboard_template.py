    ### Japan Birth Statistics Dataset Overview

    **Link to dataset**: [Japan Birth Statistics on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/japan-birth-statistics)

    This dataset covers various statistics related to births in Japan, such as birth rate, gender ratio, population, death rate, parents' ages, and the number of children per family. The data spans from **1899 to 2022**, though some years are missing due to record losses during World War II, providing over **120 years** of historical perspective.

    **Content**  
    The dataset contains around **50 columns**; however, only a selected subset will be used for our analysis. The main focus will be on predicting Japan's birth rate trends over the next few years.

    ### Project Goals
    Our project aims to use this dataset to forecast the birth rate in Japan for the next five years. Although data collection stops at 2022, the extensive historical records provide a solid foundation for predicting trends. We will also explore correlations between birth rate and factors like parents' ages and external events, such as economic downturns, pandemics, and natural disasters, to understand how these factors may influence birth rates.

    ### Proposed Models
    Given the time-series nature of this prediction, we will employ a linear regression model which would be used to test which features would impact birth rate the most in our machine learning predictions.

It is also seen that ever since 1899, the lowest birth total recorded for the dataset was 770,759.

    As we have said from earlier, the birth rate of Japan is actually declining from the years. With that said we can 
    safely assume that once again it would continue towards a downwards trend unless an external factor is brought 
    upon their country which would help their birth rate immensely.

    It would also be appropriate to mention now how there are large gaps of differences in certain places of birth rate values, 
    this is because in Japan's history there has been many occurances which made their birth rate lower.

    To mention a few, obviously the World Wars played a part in it, lowering overall birth rate, however, it is also 
    essential to take note that in the 1960s Japan birth rate plumetted all because of their superstition that females 
    born during 1966 would have a bad personality and often kill their husbands. This is called the Hinoe-Uma (Fire horse)

    Based on our opinions regarding this model is that it is quite accurate, as you can see it is clearly depicting Japan's birth rate, however it is shocking that the predicted birth rate is higher than the actual dataset values.

    We think that this is quite probably because of the fact that there are many other factors to birth rate and that we probably need to add more features but we can still also experiment and see what features may impact the birth rate other than the ones that were mentioned in the main dataset which were birth total and population total.
