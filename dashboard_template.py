    ### Japan Birth Statistics Dataset Overview

    **Link to dataset**: [Japan Birth Statistics on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/webdevbadger/japan-birth-statistics)

    This dataset covers various statistics related to births in Japan, such as birth rate, gender ratio, population, death rate, parents' ages, and the number of children per family. The data spans from **1899 to 2022**, though some years are missing due to record losses during World War II, providing over **120 years** of historical perspective.

    **Content**  
    The dataset contains around **50 columns**; however, only a selected subset will be used for our analysis. The main focus will be on predicting Japan's birth rate trends over the next few years.

    ### Project Goals
    Our project aims to use this dataset to forecast the birth rate in Japan for the next five years. Although data collection stops at 2022, the extensive historical records provide a solid foundation for predicting trends. We will also explore correlations between birth rate and factors like parents' ages and external events, such as economic downturns, pandemics, and natural disasters, to understand how these factors may influence birth rates.

    ### Proposed Models
    Given the time-series nature of this prediction, we will employ a linear regression model which would be used to test which features would impact birth rate the most in our machine learning predictions.

    The results from `dfnew.describe` show to us the different statistics that can be found within this new dataset that we have cleaned and filled with appropriate data that is missing. Here specifically we see how in each year there is an average of 1,641,856 births every year with a standard deviation of around 439,835 per year which is quite significant but understandable. It is also seen that ever since 1899, the lowest birth total recorded for the dataset was 770,759.
    Moving on, we can see how when it comes to birth rate, which is the main point of this project. The minimum value found was 6.3 while 25% was 9.97, 50% at 18.70, 75% at 32.32 and finally the maximum birth rate recorded is 36.20 which is also the latest data from 2022.
    We can see initially that the birth rate of Japan from the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were gradually increasing, but now we hear from the news how their birth rate is sharply decreasing as each year passes by, based on this we can probably conclude that the minimum value is actually Japan's current birth rate as based on graphs later, we would see how things took a turn for the worse it Japan's birth rate.
